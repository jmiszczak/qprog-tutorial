\begin{abstract}
The aim of this tutorial is to provide basic information about quantum
programming languages and methods of developing programs running on quantum
computers. We demonstrate the procedural approach by presenting implementation
of selected quantum algorithms and protocols using variouse programming
languages. We review the recent software developed for accessing commercial
quantum computers.\\[6pt]

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{What is quantum programming?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Quantum programming is a process that leads from an original formulation of a 
computing problem to executable quantum computer programs.

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{The only way to learn a new quantum programming language is 
    by writing programs in it.}

\item \emph{The process of preparing programs for a quantum computer is 
    especially attractive because it not only can be economically and 
    scientifically rewarding, it can also be an aesthetic experience much like 
    composing poetry or music.}

\item \emph{Only the modern quantum computer has made quantum 
    programming both challenging and relevant.}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Advantages of quantum programming}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{itemize}
    \item Use real quantum computers. 
    \item Play with quantum mechanics.
    \item Stretch your imagination by creating a new programming 
    language with quantum elements...
    \item ...or a language for describing quantum mechanics.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{How to do quantum programming?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
    \item  Level 0: Manipulation of quantum gates.
    Visual manipulation of gates and circuits or multiplication 
        of matrices and vectors
    
    \item Level 1: Programming QRAM. (Embedded language 
        with data abstraction and classical control of quantum memory)
    
    \item Level 2: High-level programming. (Domain specific 
        language with data and function abstraction.)
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Level 0: Direct usage of quantum gates.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
\item Visual manipulation of gates and circuits.
\item Multiplication of matrices and vectors.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}
     



\begin{itemize}
\item Direct manipulation of quantum gates, measurement.
\item Integration with text-based description of circuits: QASM 
(IBM Q) or C\texttt{\#} (QuIDE).
\item Useful for testing small circuits.
\item Not so much for real algorithms.
\item You have to live with connectivity limitations (IBM Q).
\item But you can use a real quantum computer!
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Alternative approach: Manipulation of vectors and matrices}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You already know that
\begin{itemize}
    \item quantum states are just vectors (at least we would like them 
    to 
    be)
    \item ...quantum gates are just matrices (at most $4\times 4$, and 
    don't mention the decoherence)...
    \item ...only the final step is somehow strange.
    \item{\emph{Real Programmers do Quantum Computing in FORTRAN.}}
\end{itemize}


For example, in Julia... \\[12pt] 


\todo{Include Julia code}

\todo{Examples in Wolfram can be found in the GitHub repo}


\begin{itemize}
\item Actually this is almost as good as it gets!
\item Because...
\begin{itemize}
\item ...you already know the language.
\item ...it is very easy to implement 
classical control.
\item ...it is relatively easy to take into account effects of 
decoherence.
\end{itemize}
\item Missing: the memory management.
\item And in most cases you don't need all the power/libraries/etc 
coming with the host language.
\end{itemize}

quantum primitives}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Quantum middleware}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{itemize}
\item embedded domain specific language $\rightarrow$ 
C/Python/Wolfram/Haskell
with library of functions
\item data abstraction $\rightarrow$ allocation of classical and quantum 
registers based on qu(b$|$d)its
\item quantum functions $\rightarrow$ custom elementary gates defined by 
matrices or compound statements
\item classical control of quantum memory $\rightarrow$ by using host 
language
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{...its advantages...}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
\item easy to learn and use <article>{because you already know 
the language}
\item auto-magic quantum memory management <article>{because 
qubits are just arrays}
\item integration with classical machine
<article>{obviously}
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{...and its disadvantages}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
\item very similar to low-level code <article<>{(but library 
of gates can be build)}
\item lack of expressibility <article>{$\equiv$ you operate on 
basic ingredients only}
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Example 1: ProjectQ}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{itemize}
\item Python library developed by ETH (\url{https://projectq.ch/})
\item offers various targets
\begin{itemize}
\item hardware (IBM Q Experience) 
<article>{(\verb|use_hardware=False|)}
\item resource counter (???)
\item graphical circuit representation
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item \texttt{quscratch} --- has to be empty before and after the 
call.
\end{itemize}

Types of quantum functions:
\begin{itemize}

computation,
\item \texttt{qufunct} --- used to implement irreversible functions,
